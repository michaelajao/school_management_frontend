## Key Flows

### Onboarding

1. **Registration** (`/app/onboarding/page.tsx`): Collects basic user info (`RegistrationForm`) and redirects based on selected role.

2. **Role Forms**:
   - **Superadmin/Admin**: `/app/onboarding/admin/page.tsx` uses `components/onboarding/SuperadminAndSchoolpage.tsx` for detailed profile and school setup (name, address, logo, brand color, etc.).
   - **Teacher/Parent/Student**: Simpler profile forms located under `/app/onboarding/[role]/page.tsx`.

3. **Validation**: The `useFormValidation` hook manages required fields and displays inline error messages for a smooth user experience.

### Payment & Pricing

- **Pricing Page** (`/app/paymentGateway/page.tsx` using `components/PricingView/pricingView.tsx`): Displays subscription plans. Superadmins select a plan, enter mock payment details, and are redirected to onboarding upon "successful" payment.
- **Mock Payment** (`/app/mockPayment/page.tsx`): A standalone page for demonstrating the payment form UI.
- **Success Modal** (`components/modal/Successfulmodal.tsx`): Shown after mock payment, includes a countdown before redirecting.

---

## UI Component Library & Styling

- **Shadcn UI**: The core component library, located in `components/ui`. These are unstyled primitives built on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS. See `components.json` for configuration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for all styling, configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/globals.css`. Utility classes provide rapid development and consistency.
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)**: Used within Shadcn components (like `Button`) for managing component variants.
- **`cn` Utility**: (`lib/utils.ts`) Merges Tailwind classes, essential for conditional styling in components.

---

## State Management & Context

- **AuthContext** (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`): Manages simulated user authentication state (user object, loading status). Persists user info in `localStorage` for session persistence across refreshes. Provides context to protect routes and display user-specific UI.
- **PricingStore** (`store/usePricingStore.ts`): A Zustand store for managing global state related to the pricing flow, such as the selected plan and user email. Zustand provides a simple and powerful way to handle state outside of the React component tree, with persistence middleware included.

---

## Custom Hooks

- **`useFormValidation`** (`hooks/useFormValidation.ts`): A generic hook to handle form validation logic. Takes form data and a list of required fields, returning an `errors` object, a `validate` function, and a `clearError` function.
- **`useMobile`** (`hooks/use-mobile.ts`): Detects if the current device screen width corresponds to mobile or tablet breakpoints, returning boolean flags (`isMobile`, `isTablet`). Useful for conditional rendering based on device type.

---

## Responsiveness

- The application utilizes Tailwind CSS's responsive design features (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes) to ensure layouts adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.
- Key components like forms, cards, and navigation are designed with responsiveness in mind.
- The `useMobile` hook can be used for more complex JavaScript-based responsive logic if needed.

---

## Testing

- **Jest**: The primary testing framework, configured in `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.ts`.
- **React Testing Library (RTL)**: Used for writing tests that interact with components similarly to how a user would. Encourages accessible and maintainable tests.
- Sample tests are located in the `_tests_` directory (e.g., `Home.test.tsx`, `Onboarding.test.tsx`). Run tests using `npm test` or `yarn test`.

---

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm run dev`** - Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack
- **`npm run build`** - Builds the app for production
- **`npm start`** - Runs the built app in production mode
- **`npm run lint`** - Runs ESLint to check code quality
- **`npm test`** - Launches the test runner in watch mode

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="School Management System"

# Theme
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_THEME=light

# Mock API (for development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_API=true
```

---

## API Routes

The application includes mock API routes for development:

### User Management
- `GET /api/users` - Fetch all users
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` - Delete user

### Class Management
- `GET /api/classes` - Fetch all classes
- `POST /api/classes` - Create new class
- `PUT /api/classes/[id]` - Update class
- `DELETE /api/classes/[id]` - Delete class

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Docker Deployment

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile

RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Optimization**: Uses Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic route-based code splitting with Next.js
- **Bundle Analysis**: Run `npm run build` to see bundle size analysis
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are lazy-loaded where appropriate
- **Caching**: Leverages Next.js caching strategies for optimal performance

---

## Security Features

- **Authentication**: Simulated auth with secure localStorage persistence
- **Role-Based Access**: Route protection based on user roles
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Development server won't start**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and reinstall dependencies
   rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Build errors**
   ```bash
   # Check TypeScript errors
