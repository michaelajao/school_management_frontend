```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Test specific dashboard
npm run test:integration -- --grep "teacher-dashboard"
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with specific browser
npm run test:e2e -- --browser=chrome

# Run in headless mode
npm run test:e2e -- --headless
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Notification Badge Not Updating
**Symptoms:** Badge count doesn't reflect actual unread notifications
**Solution:** Check WebSocket connection and state management

### 2. Tab Content Not Loading
**Symptoms:** Tab switches but content remains empty
**Solution:** Verify data fetching triggers and loading states

### 3. Mobile Layout Issues
**Symptoms:** Content overflow or improper responsive behavior
**Solution:** Check Tailwind CSS responsive classes and container constraints

### 4. Performance Degradation
**Symptoms:** Slow rendering with large datasets
**Solution:** Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, or memoization

## Test Data Requirements
